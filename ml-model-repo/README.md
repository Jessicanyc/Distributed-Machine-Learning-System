## ML Model Repository

Contains the machine learning models' code, including data preprocessing, model training and evaluation scripts, and any associated artifacts such as trained models and evaluation metrics. It  also include Dockerfiles for containerizing the training and inference environments.

Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, building, and versioning of ML models. Leverage Kubeflow Pipelines for executing model training and evaluation tasks in the cluster, and ensure models are versioned and stored in an accessible model registry
