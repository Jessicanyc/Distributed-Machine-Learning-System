## Deployment Strategy: 

If fully committed to using Helm for all Kubernetes deployments due to its advantages in managing configurations, versions, and releases, then the plain YAML files in an applications directory might not be necessary. Helm can completely replace these files by providing more dynamic, scalable, and maintainable deployment processes.

## Environment and Use Cases:

Development and Testing: Sometimes, developers might prefer using plain YAML files for quick, ad-hoc testing or during development to avoid the overhead of configuring Helm values. In such cases, keeping a directory with basic Kubernetes YAML files can be beneficial.

## Backup and Fallback:

Some teams maintain a set of plain Kubernetes YAML files as a backup or for emergency use cases where Helm might not be available or its use could be impractical. This can act as a fallback mechanism to ensure deployments can still be managed manually if needed.
