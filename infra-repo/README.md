## Infrastructure Repository

This repository contains all the necessary infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates and scripts for provisioning and managing the underlying cloud infrastructure on AWS, including the Kubernetes cluster setup with Kops, networking configurations, IAM roles, and security policies. It  also include Argo CD application manifests for continuous deployment of the system componentsï¼Œ it also manages how applications are deployed using helm

I Use KOps to define the infrastructure, ensuring that the cloud resources are version-controlled, reproducible, and easily auditable. Organize the templates into logical modules or stacks, such as networking, security, and Kubernetes cluster configurations, to improve readability and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Tools and Software Requirements

To manage a Kubernetes cluster with Kops on AWS, we need several tools installed within a CI/CD pipeline environment. 

- **Kops**: To create and manage Kubernetes clusters.
- **kubectl**: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
- **AWS CLI**: To manage AWS resources.
- **Terraform** (optional): for managing additional AWS resources outside of what Kops handles.
- **Helm** (optional): For managing Kubernetes applications.


## Tools Installation
### Kops

- **Purpose**: Kops is used to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/v1.22.0/kops-linux-amd64
  chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
  sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops
  ```

### kubectl

- **Purpose**: kubectl is the Kubernetes command-line tool, allowing us to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
  chmod +x ./kubectl
  sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
  ```

### AWS CLI

- **Purpose**: The AWS CLI is used to manage AWS services.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
  unzip awscliv2.zip
  sudo ./aws/install
  ```

### Terraform 

- **Purpose**: Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.7/terraform_0.14.7_linux_amd64.zip
  unzip terraform_0.14.7_linux_amd64.zip
  sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
  ```

### Helm 
- **Purpose**: Helm helps manage Kubernetes applications.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
  ```

## Configuration

Ensure we configure each tool appropriately:

- **AWS CLI**: Configure with `aws configure` to set up your AWS credentials.
- **Kops**: Set up an S3 bucket for your Kops state store and configure the Kops environment variables:
  ```bash
  export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://<your-kops-state-bucket>
  ```

## Usage

Use these tools within CI/CD pipelines to manage and deploy Kubernetes clusters and related resources.

### Next Steps

- Populate the repository with actual infrastructure-as-code configurations, such as Kops YAML files for cluster definitions.
- Optionally, include scripts or CI/CD pipeline definitions that automate the provisioning and management tasks using these tools.

This approach provides a comprehensive guide within your repository for setting up the environment necessary to manage your infrastructure effectively.
