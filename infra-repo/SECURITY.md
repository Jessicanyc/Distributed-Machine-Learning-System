# Security Practices

This document outlines best practices and guidelines for managing credentials and sensitive data securely.

## Managing AWS Credentials

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to inject AWS credentials into your development environment and CI/CD pipelines securely.
- **IAM Roles**: Utilize IAM roles for EC2 instances and AWS services to automatically handle permissions without the need to store credentials.
- **Secrets Management**: Implement a secrets management tool like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive data across all environments.
- **CI/CD Secrets**: Use built-in secrets management capabilities in CI/CD platforms to securely manage and inject credentials during the deployment process.

## Recommendations

- Always use encrypted connections (HTTPS, SSL/TLS) to interact with your services.
- Regularly review and rotate credentials.
- Follow the principle of least privilege by granting the minimum permissions necessary for your applications and services.
